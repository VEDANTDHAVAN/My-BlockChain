This project is a custom-built blockchain, developed from scratch to demonstrate the fundamental concepts behind blockchain technology, including block structure, chaining blocks, mining, and transaction management.

Features
Block Structure: Each block contains essential data, including a timestamp, data, previous hash, and its own hash.
Chaining of Blocks: Each new block references the hash of the previous block, creating a secure chain of blocks.
Proof of Work (Mining): Implemented a basic proof-of-work mechanism to simulate mining and validate blocks.
Transaction Management: Support for adding transactions to blocks.
Blockchain Integrity: Ensures data immutability with cryptographic hashing and verification mechanisms.

Run the Blockchain:

bash
Copy code
python3 main.py

Project Structure:
blockchain.py: Contains logic for managing the chain, adding new blocks, and validating the blockchain.
main.py: Entry point to run the blockchain and simulate transactions.

Usage:
Start the Blockchain: Run main.py to create a new blockchain and start adding blocks.

Add Transactions: Modify main.py to add transactions and experiment with block mining.

Blockchain Validation: Use the built-in functions to check if the blockchain is valid after each new block is added.

Concepts Covered:
Cryptographic Hashing: Ensures block immutability.
Proof of Work: Simulates mining with a proof-of-work algorithm.
Decentralized Ledger: A basic implementation of a distributed ledger concept.

Future Improvements:
Adding a peer-to-peer networking layer
Implementing consensus algorithms like Proof of Stake
Creating a simple frontend interface for interaction
